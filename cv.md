**Summary**

I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University of Telecommunications and got my bachelor's degree in radiotechnology in 2019.
Though I have very little experience in coding (about 2 month), I spend time every day learning something new and practicing.
I underwent a HTML/CSS course on Stepik and started to learn JS and algorithms.
My goal is to become a good front-end developer.
